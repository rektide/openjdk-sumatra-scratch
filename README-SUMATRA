The Sumatra repository forest is a recent copy of the following:
  http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8/jdk8
  http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8/jdk8/{corba,jaxp,jaxws,langtools,jdk,hotspot}

The corba and jax* repositories are present for completeness,
but changes are not expected there.

There is an extra repository "scratch" which holds ad hoc stand-alone
experiments or patches which are not integrated with the OpenJDK
sources.  It is specific to Sumatra.

More information on Project Sumatra repositories is in this wiki:
